# Bayesian-Statistics
A repo for all my work on Bayesian Statistics. These documents are mainly summaries or work related to my personal study on Bayesian Statistics. At the moment, the reads I'm immersed in are:
1. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition. Gelman, A. and Carlin, J.B. and Stern, H.S. and Dunson, D.B. and Vehtari, A. and Rubin, D.B.

Index:
- Hemophilia.qmd: A simple report on Hemophilia and how Bayesian Statistics are used in genetic problems. Example on book 1.
